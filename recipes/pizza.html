        <h3>This detroit style pizza will quickly become one of your weekly go-to recipes!</h3>

        <p>
            After searching and searching for a great homemade pizza I finally came across this recipe and it's changed everything.
            It takes about 2 1/2 hours from start but maybe about 20 minutes of actual work. We'll also be making the sauce to go along with it.
            All your friends will be totally impressed!

                off a piece and stretch it until very thin and translucent without tearing. 
                Set the bowl over the top and let rise for 30 minutes. 
                Stir the sauce and remove the lid, let simmer for another 30 minutes. -

                Add the chopped basil and adjust the seasoning to taste. 
                Store in the fridge until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Get out a Detroit-style pizza pan or quarter baking sheet and add the olive oil. 
                Toss the dough in and stretch to the edges until it starts to spring back. 
                Let rest for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 F (232 C) - Use this time to do dishes, 
                watch tv, grab a workout.</li>
            <li>Top the pizza by laying the chiles and oregano down first and follow with the shredded mozzarella. 
                Spoon over the sauce in 3 strips. Bake for about 20 minutes until the crust is golden brown and 
                crispy and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
            <li>Slide the cooked pizza onto a cooling rack for 5 minutes before slicing and enjoying.</li>
